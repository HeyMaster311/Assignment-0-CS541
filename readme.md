Twin prime: It is the solution for the first problem. The algorithm is designed based on a fact that every composite number will have at least one factor (besides 1)which is smaller than or equal to its square root. If this factor can be found, the algorithm could make sure that the number is not prime.

Greyscale: It is the solution for the second problem. The coding obeys the requirements in our assignment. Thank my best friend, Mr. Liu, for his allowing me to using his portrait as a part of the project. The input file is /root/Assignment 0/WechatIMG23.jpeg, while the output is /root/Assignment 0/outfile.jpeg.

Summary: It is the solution for the third problem. It is not much about innovation, but I did learn a lot about how to deal with dataframe and list. The data source file is shown as /root/Assignment 0/us-states.csv
